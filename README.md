# What did you do particularly well?
I liked how I documentated all the functions in the app
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
With my current understanding of programming, it's hard to see where I can improve my code.
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did find some aspects hard, but whenever I had any difficulty, I looked up the errors on stack overflow.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Making the code scalable and compartmentalized. I used this method throughout the course.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by commenting features, using good naming conventions, and making it easy to add features in the future.
